# Week 12 - Now with more MOLECULES!!!

## Summary

This is a JavaScript challenge.

**Because y'all hate regex so much, and it would make this challenge too straightforward, its use here is banned**

Given a string representing a chemical compound, return the sum of the atomic numbers for the respective elements in the string.

## Example

Input: `H2SO4`

Output: `50`

Explanation: `H*2 + S + O*4 = 1*2 + 16 + 8*4 = 50`

## Specifics

* USE OF REGEX IS BANNED
* Reference: look at a periodic table
* A keyed object of element => atomic number is provided in the challenge code as the var "e" in the global NS. This variable exists outside the scope of the golfing challenge (you can use it, but not edit it)
