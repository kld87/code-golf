## Code Golf

"Code Golf" is a programming challenge where the winner is the one who solves the problem with the fewest characters of code as possible.

## About

After coming across [the concept on StackExchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/), I decided to run a weekly competition for the devs at my old office Job. I was happy with the engagement and participation that resulted; people seemed to have fun, learn some new quirks and tricks in languages they already used every day, and improved their lateral thinking skills. I've decided to host these challenges here for anyone who's interested.

## Usage

Read the rules.md, then progress thru the week# folders by reading each associated week's .md, then attempting the related challenge file. Challenges were primarily in PHP (specifically HHVM since we used that at work) and JS.

## Source Material

The challenge for Week 1 was taken from the [first challenge I did on StackExchange](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/116507/turn-me-22-5-with-a-rose/116519). Some of the other challenges were adapted from [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.ca/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850), some from previous programming challenges/competitions I'd done, and some I simply pulled out of my brain.
